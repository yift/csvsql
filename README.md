# csvsql
CSV SQL is a SQL like engine that works on CSV file.

## Why
The aim of this utility is to read and manipulate CSV files from the command line without the need to use point and click spreadsheet. 

## What can it be use for
The csvsql was built to be a command line interface to read and manipulate CSV files. A fast and simple command line alternative to Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice calc. Once can use it to read and manipulate CSV files while separating the source data, from the visualization (the formats, charts, hidden column, filters...) and the actions (the SQL queries).

## What can't you use it for
It is not a real SQL engine, not only that it won't support al lot of the feature that all SQL databases has, it also diverge from some of the core SQL features and has no concept of index.
